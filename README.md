Create an app that can be accessed from a [command line](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/#finding-the-command-line).

This project is based on Atul's [blog post](https://medium.com/@atulanand94/building-web-based-uis-for-terminals-using-javascript-60b5eee31213) and [GitHub project](https://github.com/master-atul/console-web-ui).

See `routes/index.js` and `hello.js` and `racing.js` inside the `helpers` folder.
